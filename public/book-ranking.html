<h2>My top 4 books of all time</h2>

<br />
<h3>You Deserve Each Other</h3>
<h4>Book by Sarah Hogle</h4>
<p>
  It's a lovers to enemies to friends to lover kind of book. How could I not
  love this?! Though I got annoyed at the characters in the first half, the
  second half was worth enduirng it.. They really deserved each other.

<h3>The Love Hypothesis</h3>

<p>
  I can't remember how many times I read this book. But definitely remember
  loving it every time.

<h3>The hating game</h3>
<h4>Book by Sally Thorne</h4>
<p>
  When I first read the books, it seemed like an okay kind of book. But when I
  re-read it, I fell in love..

<h3>The Mindf*ck Series</h3>
<h4>Book series by S.T. Abby</h4>

  The FMC is a freaking psychopath serial killer (with a good motive)! What else
  do I want?
